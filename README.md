# Blog
The goal of the task is to write a simple web application that is a blogging engine.

The requirements for the system are the following:
####● Create blog post (title, content)
####● View blog post (title, content, average rating, list of reviews)
####● Archive blog post
####● Add blog post review (title, content, rating)
####● Delete blog post review
The user interface can be very basic (simple UI elements, no security layer etc.), invest your
time in code quality, not the visual representation or infrastructure.
You can decide whether you focus with implementation on the frontend or backend. Pick the
one you feel more comfortable with.
Treat the project as a PoC so e.g. persistent storage is not a requirement.
